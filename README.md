# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This webpage was built to help bootcamp students gain a basic understanding of different programs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git) and have a consolidated place to house their prework notes. Building this website was a project that helped explain how the three languages interact with each other (structure, style, and user interactity) and a few coding basics from each of these, all while following web development best practices along the way. With the website in place, bootcamp students also have the tools they need to update the website with prework notes.

## Usage

This webpage contains four different sections (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) with corresponding notes about each section topic. See the notes below each topic for more information. On the website, you can see where HTML and CSS code was applied. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript code that was applied. The intent of this code is to list out all prework topics, and then present the user with a randomized topic to dive into first.
